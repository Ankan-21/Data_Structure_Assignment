        "Ans:-\n",
        "String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract a part of a string by specifying a range of indices. This is especially useful for text manipulation and data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax\n",
        "The basic syntax for slicing a string is:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "substring = string[start:end:step]  \n",
        "start: The index of the first character we want to include in the slice (inclusive).\n",
        "end: The index of the last character we want to include in the slice (exclusive).\n",
        "step: This is optional; it defines the increment between each index in the slice. If not specified, the default step is 1.\n",
        "Examples\n",
        "Basic Slicing:\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"  \n",
        "sliced = text[0:5]  # 'Hello'  \n",

        "\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"  \n",

        "\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"  \n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:- In Python, lists are versatile, ordered collections of items that can hold a variety of data types. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements. The position of each element is defined by its index, starting from 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable: Lists can be changed after their creation. we can modify, add, or remove elements.\n",

        "Dynamic Size: Lists can grow and shrink in size as needed, allowing for flexible management of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Heterogeneous: Lists can contain elements of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexing and Slicing: we can access elements using indexes. Negative indexing allows we to reference elements from the end of the list. Slicing allows we to get a subset of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Built-in Methods: Python provides many built-in methods for lists, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.\n",
        "insert(): Inserts an element at a specified index.\n",
        "remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
        "pop(): Removes and returns an element at a specified index (or the last element if no index is specified).\n",
        "sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.\n",
        "reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in the list.\n",
        "List Comprehensions: Python supports list comprehensions, which provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nested Lists: Lists can contain other lists, allowing for the creation of multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Length: we can determine the size of a list using the len() function.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:- Tuples and lists are both built-in data structures in Python used for storing collections of items. However, they have key differences in terms of mutability, syntax, and use cases. Below is a comparison highlighting their characteristics, along with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mutability\n",
        "Lists: Lists are mutable, meaning we can change their contents after they are created (add, modify, or remove elements).\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# List example  \n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]  \n",

        "print(my_tuple)        # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Syntax\n",
        "Lists: Lists are created using square brackets [].\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are created using parentheses ().\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating a list  \n",

        "\n",
        "3. Use Cases\n",
        "Lists: Lists are commonly used when we need a collection of items that may need to be changed. They are suitable for scenarios where the size of data may vary or when item manipulation is necessary (e.g., appending, removing).\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are useful when we want to ensure that the data remains constant throughout the program. They can also be used as keys in dictionaries due to their immutability, while lists cannot.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# List use case  \n",
        "shopping_list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries']  \n",
        "shopping_list.append('dates')  # Updating the list  \n",
        "print(shopping_list)  # Output: ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries', 'dates']  \n",
        "\n",
        "# Tuple use case  \n",
        "coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)  # Immutable coordinates  \n",
        "# coordinates[0] = 15.0      # This will raise TypeError  \n",
        "print(coordinates)   # Output: (10.0, 20.0)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Performance\n",
        "Lists: Generally, lists have a slightly more overhead for their dynamic size (they can grow and shrink), which may affect performance when handling large datasets.\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient than lists because they are fixed in size.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Methods\n",
        "Lists: Lists come with a larger set of built-in methods, such as append(), remove(), extend(), insert(), and more.\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples have fewer methods, mainly count() and index().\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# List methods  \n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]  \n",

        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2)  \n",
        "print(my_tuple.count(2))   # Output: 2 (counts occurrences of 2)  \n",
        "print(my_tuple.index(3))   # Output: 2 (returns index of first occurrence of 3)  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:- In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable types, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. This characteristic is crucial for the integrity and functionality of dictionaries. Here’s a detailed discussion on the importance of dictionary keys being immutable, along with examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Hashability Requirement\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python use a hash table for storage. Each key in a dictionary must be hashable, which implies that it has a fixed hash value when stored. Mutable objects like lists or dictionaries themselves cannot have a consistent hash value since their contents can change, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Attempting to Use a List as a Key\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict = {}  \n",
        "my_list_key = [1, 2, 3]  \n",
        "\n",
        "# This will raise a TypeError  \n",

        "    my_dict[my_list_key] = \"value\"  \n",
        "except TypeError as e:  \n",
        "    print(e)  # Output: unhashable type: 'list'  \n",
        "In contrast, immutable types like strings, tuples, and numbers maintain a consistent hash value, allowing them to be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Integrity and Consistency\n",
        "Having immutable keys helps maintain the integrity and consistency of dictionary data. If mutable objects were allowed as keys, the key could change, leading to data loss or erroneous lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Changes in a Mutable Key\n",
        "\n",

        "# my_dict[my_list_key] = \"value\"  \n",
        "#   \n",
        "# Now if we modify the list:  \n",

        "\n",
        "# This scenario illustrates how it could lead to inconsistencies.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Efficient Lookups\n",
        "Since dictionary keys are hashed, having immutable keys allows for efficient lookups. The fixed hash value ensures that retrieving items is fast and predictable, as the location of the key-value pair does not change during the program's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Key Lookup\n",

        "In this example, the tuple (1, 2) serves as a key, and its immutability guarantees reliable access.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Complex Data Structures\n",
        "Using immutable types as keys allows for the construction of more complex data structures. For instance, tuples can contain multiple elements, making them useful for representing composite keys.\n",
